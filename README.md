# AI-Based Voting Recommendation

## Overview
AI-Based Voting Recommendation is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to provide intelligent voting suggestions based on a user's preferences and past voting behavior. The system leverages artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and fairness in the recommendation process.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Recommendations**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze voting trends and provide personalized voting suggestions.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensures secure and tamper-proof voting recommendations using blockchain technology.
- **Transparency & Security**: All recommendation logs are recorded on the blockchain, maintaining trust and integrity.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for users to interact with the recommendation system.
- **Decentralized & Immutable**: Powered by smart contracts, eliminating the risk of centralized control or data manipulation.

## Smart Contract Deployment
This project is deployed on the **Edu Chain** with the following contract address:
```
